/*
Alright, let's test your understanding of while loops in JavaScript. 
Imagine you have a piggy bank filled with coins and you want to count them all!
You know there are at least 10 coins, but you don't know the exact amount. 

Here's the challenge: write a program using a while loop that keeps track of the number of coins
you take out one by one, and stops counting once you've reached 10 coins. 

Can you write the code to achieve this? Remember, the loop should keep iterating 
as long as the number of coins counted is less than 10.
*/
function countCoins(coins){
  let count = 0;  
  while(count<=10){
    
  }
}

let coins = [2,5,10,2,1,5,10,2,1,1,5];
console.log(`is Coin Count 10 ->`+countCoins(coins));
