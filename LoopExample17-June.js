I'd be glad to act as your JS tutor! Here's an intermediate coding question based on the loop concept:

**Challenge:**

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array
containing only the prime numbers from the original array. 

**Constraints:**

* A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
* You can't use built-in functions for primality checking (e.g., `isPrime`).
* Utilize a loop (e.g., `for`, `while`) to iterate through the array and determine primality for each number.

**Tips:**

* Inside the loop, consider using another loop to check for divisibility.
* Remember that 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

This problem requires understanding loops, conditionals, and some basic number theory for primality checks.
It's a great exercise to solidify your loop concepts and problem-solving skills in JavaScript.

Feel free to ask any questions you have while tackling this challenge. 
I'm here to guide you through the thought process without giving away the entire solution. Good luck!

function getPrimeNumbers(numbers){
 let primeNums = [];   
 for(let i=0;i<numbers.length();i++){
    if(numbers[i]>1){
        if(numbers[i] % 2
    }
 }
}

let arr1 = [1,2];
